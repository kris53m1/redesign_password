                    <h3><b>How to prepare for your Microblading Appointment</b></h3>
                    <div class="narrow_one_p">
                        <p> <b>Two weeks prior</b> to your Microblading appointment please avoid chemical peels, Botox, fillers and retinoids, (and 30 days post appointment) avoid laser and or dermabrasion of any type.</p>
                        <p><b>One week prior</b> to your appointment please avoid excess sun exposure and do not tan.</p>
                        <p><b>24-hours prior</b> to your appointment it is recommended that you do not drink alcohol, take aspirin, Ibuprofen, niacin, Omega 3 (fish oil) or Vitamin E.</p>
                        <p><b>On the day</b> of your appointment do <b>not</b> drink coffee or anything that contains caffeine as it may cause bleeding.</p>
                        <p>Your skin must <b>not</b> be in the process of healing when getting a Microblading treatment. So you need to wait 6 months AFTER you’re done with your Accutane treatment before having Microblading done on your brows.</p>

                    <div class="narrow_two_p">
                        <p>During the Touch-up Appointment I will fill in any missing hair strokes, fill out the shape of the eyebrow as necessary, touch up any light spots, and assess how the skin has reacted to the Microblading process and the chosen color. I make a note of the client’s pigment blend. I can enhance the color of the brows by simply layering in a different shade if needed, to adjust the tone. There are always options.</p>

                    <h3><b>Do all eyebrows require a Touch-up Appointment?</b></h3>
                    <div class="narrow_two_p">
                        <p>Yes. But not before and only AFTER 6-8 weeks Post-Microblading can your Touch-up appointment be scheduled. Microblading requires a second touch up appointment, all client’s skin is different and receives the ink differently. It’s impossible to accurately predict how a pigment will be affected by a client’s undertones. So please book your Touch-up appointment 6-8 weeks following your Microblading appointment.</p>

                            <p>For most clients the results of quality Microblading will last anywhere from 18-24 months. The pigment naturally exfoliates out of the skin over time causing the pigment to lighten.</p>
